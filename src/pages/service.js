            <p>18+ Edtech. Our users start as individual language learners, find a match in our Asian &amp; Pacific Islander (API) to non-API matchpool, and evolve to learn languages together. </p>
            <p>We noticed a few problems with language learning apps:<br />Lack of human personalization<br />Users losing motivation to continue learning a language from the start of the journey</p>
            <p>We also noticed a generational decrease in native heritage API (Asian &amp; Pacific Islander) languages spoken in the US. Just 12% of Third Generation API people speak their native heritage language. </p>
            <p>We also noticed how social networking apps designed to meet romantic partners have patterns of racism towards API men and women, and despite internet article after article demanding these sites take action,  no progress has been observed.</p>
            <p>So we decided to add more motivation to retain API languages in the US, create a safe space for API people to meet non-API people, and an immersive/personalized language learning experience.</p>
            <p>Our technology is location based, and helps users find native speakers of the specific language they are learning. How do we help users progress with language education? Once a user finds a match and message, they can easily see each message translated in the language they are learning. There are 4 crucial aspects to language learning- we are using NLP to build a listening and speaking system that allows a user to speak directly, make an impression of their voice, and have an AI audio-translate the message with a recreated version of the user's voice. We currently have a text-auto translate feature for users to see their messages text translated to the language they're learning.</p>
